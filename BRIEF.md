#Assignment 4 - REST Web Services  

## 1 Tasks  
Your team was assigned to develop a temperature converter application using REST web
services.  

  - The application would enable to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.  
  - You will need to have a web service for the temperature conversion.  
  - The application should respond to GET requests for HTML and JSON (you can use GSON or Jackson to convert Java objects to JSON) i.e. the application responds with JSON or HTML. The input is a URL parameter.   
  - You will need to have a client that will consume the Web Services. The REST service should be written using Jersey and you can use the example app on Moodle to get you started.  
  - To write a client to consume the service I recommend using the Apache HTTPclient Java Library, but you can choose another language.  
  
## Extra  
This section is worth 10%  
Create web services:  

  - to handle a POST request to add a user to a fake system, the request would specify the user information  
  - to return random text given a length parameter  
  
## Deadline
